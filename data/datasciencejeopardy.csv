1,"Evaluation Criteria","Calculated by summing across the diagonal entries of a confusion matrix and dividing by the total number of observations, this metric fails in the presence of class imbalance.","What is ""accuracy"", ""traditional accuracy""?"
2,"Ensemble Methods","This classic algorithm leverages many weak classifiers, in combination with a reweighting scheme to  improve predictive accuracy.  It's commonly associated with decision trees.","What is ""AdaBoost""?"
3,"Evaluation Criteria","This closely related cousin of a linear regression evaluation metric seeks to quantify explained variance only after compensating for extraneous explanatory variables.","What is ""Adjusted R-Squared""?"
4,"Unsupervised Learning","Observations begin as their own individual cluster, but this procedure iteratively combines these points into clusters as some merging criteria has been met.","What is ""Agglomerative clustering""?"
5,"Evaluation Criteria","By adding a scaled penalization parameter to the scaled negative log likelihood, this resulting value can be used for model selection.","What is ""Akaike information criterion""?"
6,Visualization,"This famous dataset, collected by R.A. Fisher, was introduced in his 1936 paper as an example of linear dicriminant analysis.","What is the ""Iris data set""?"
7,Visualization,"Due to very similar statistical properties, these four datasets highlight the short comings of only using summary statistics to characterize recorded information.","What is ""Ascombe's Quartet""?"
8,"Famous Statisticians","This famous statistician from Iowa State has his own ""-verse"", a collection of highly influential R packages written and maintained by he and his adherrents.","Who is ""Hadley Wickham""?"
9,"Evaluation Criteria","This section below the Reciever Operating Characteristic curve is known to serve as an accuracy metric for asessing the quality of binary classifiers.","What is the ""Area Under the Curve""?"
10,Representations,"As a specialized structure to encode text data, this characteristization sets each row as an observation, it's columns as individual words and within it's cells contain a binary 0 or 1 to indicate the presence of the word.","What is a ""bag of words model""?"
11,"Ensemble Methods","After randomly sampling the data with replacement, this technique fits a separate model to each dataset and uses a voting scheme to determine the final set of predictions.","What is ""Bootstrap Aggregation""?"
12,"Evaluation Criteria","The lowest possible error rate for any classifier of a random outcome is characterized by this name.","What is ""Bayes Error""?"
13,"Classical Statistics","This famous theorem derives a posterior distribution by scaling a prior and two different likelihood functions.","What is ""Bayes Theorem""?"
14,Visualization,"Coining the terms ""chartjunk"" and ""data-ink"" ratio, this famous professor of Statistics was instrumental in forming the theory of modern visualization and design concepts.","Who is ""Edward Tufte""?"
15,Visualization,"This professor of Statistics and Computer Science at Purdue University developed the nonparametric technique of LOESS or LOWESS Regression","Who is ""William (Bill) Cleveland""?"
16,"Classical Statistics","Phonetically, but mistakenly pronounced ""chee"", this ""squared"" statistic is used to determine if rows and columns in a bivariate table are independent.","What is the ""Chi-Squared"" statistic?"
17,"Machine Learning","K-means is the most popular algorithm of this class of techniques used to group observations.","What is ""Clustering""?"
18,"Classical Statistics","By adding and subtracting a scaled version of the standard error of a parameter, this method returns a range that contains the true parameter value with a well defined level of certainty.","What is a ""Confidence Interval""?"
19,"Classical Statistics","The weak version of this law  gives a probabilistic guarantee that as a statistician collects more data the sample mean will converge to the population mean.","What is the ""Law of Large Numbers""?"
20,"Machine Learning","This phenomena, and its ominous name, warns statisticians of the counter-intuitive effects of adding more variables when performing distance calculations between observations.","What is the ""Curse of Dimensionality""?"
21,"Evaluation Criteria","Created by Dr. Lawrence Mosley in 2013 for multi-class imbalance model evaluation, this metric calculates a lower bound for the average precision and average recall of a classification result.","What is ""Class Balance Accuracy""?"
,"Machine Learning","With terms like leafs and branches, this machine learning techniques splits datasets along features with high information gain to create classification rules.","What is a ""Decision Tree""?"
